## Problem statement

Readers these days are more inclined to use online sources of news mainly due to two key reasons: interactivity and immediacy. However, news on the internet can be quite polarising these days. 

Sentiment analysis can help analyze this information and categorize it as positive, negative, and neutral.

## Proposed Solution

- Extracting news about a topic from various sources and performing sentiment analysis on it.
- The news, analysed through natural language processing tools, gives positive, negative and neutral percentage for the user to get a better understanding about the topic.
- Providing visual representation in the form of a pie chart to give an even clearer understanding of the news analysis.

## Tech Stacks

* Client-Side  : HTML3, CSS5, Vanila Js
* Server-Side  : Flask
* Libraries    : TextBlob, Requests_html

## Features

- Automatically scrapes Google News upon entering the topic
- Providing visual analysis of sentiments in the form of piechart
- Providing positive, negative and neutral percentages of news sentiment
- Clean interface with all necessary details about our services and products

## Possible Improvisation

- Sentiments other than positive, negative and neutral can be introduced in the application. 
This will help in deep understanding of sentiments about the topic.
- We can scrape data from various social media websites other than Google News to incorporate large number of views and opinions about a topic
- Image, Audio, and Video Sentiment Analysis can be introduced as well.
- Analysis of news in multiple languages to get opinions of people of every region around the globe.
